\section{Introduction}
Despite a century of advances, global existence and smoothness for 3D incompressible Navier--Stokes remain open \citep{fefferman2006ns,clayproblem}.
We introduce a complementary \emph{Adaptive Resistance Principle} (ARP) lens: with an auxiliary $G$ driven by $\Phi(u)$, set $V=E+\lambda G$ to tune dissipation analytically and to guide adaptive stabilization numerically.
